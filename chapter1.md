# Workflow

* **Dependency Management Tool - npm or yarn**
* **Bundler - Webpack **
* **Compiler - Babel with presets**
* **Development Server**

Out of box setup for the development computer can be done with [**create-react-app**](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

To start the development server you can use:

```
npm start
```

To initialize an app with create-react app:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

**note: npx **_**comes with npm 5.2+ and higher**_
