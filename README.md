A [thunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk) is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.

```js
// calculation of 1 + 2 is immediate
// x === 3
let x = 1 + 2;

// calculation of 1 + 2 is delayed
// foo can be called later to perform the calculation
// foo is a thunk!
let foo = () => 1 + 2;
```
